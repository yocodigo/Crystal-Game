## Rules

1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
2. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
4. Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
5. When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
6. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
7. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
8. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
